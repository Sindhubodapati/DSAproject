# Hangman Game - java

## Introduction
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The provided Java code implements a simple version of the Hangman game, allowing for both single-player and two-player modes.

## Code Overview
The code consists of a single Java class `Hangman`, which serves as the main entry point for the game.

### 1. Input and Output
The game interacts with the player(s) through the console using `Scanner` for input and `System.out.println()` for output.

### 2. Word Selection
- In single-player mode, a random word is selected from a text file (`words_alpha.txt`) containing a list of English words.
- In two-player mode, one player inputs a word for the other player to guess.

### 3. Game Logic
The game logic revolves around the following key components:

#### a. Guessing Mechanism
Players guess letters of the secret word. If a guessed letter is present in the word, it is revealed; otherwise, a part of the hangman figure is drawn as a penalty.

#### b. Win and Lose Conditions
- The player wins if they successfully guess all the letters in the word.
- The player loses if they exhaust all their attempts (6 incorrect guesses).

### 4. Data Structures Used
- **ArrayList**: Used to store the list of words read from the file and to maintain the guessed letters by the player.
- **String**: Represents the secret word to be guessed.

### 5. Algorithms
- **Random Selection**: The game uses a random number generator to select a word from the list of words in single-player mode.
- **Linear Search**: Checking whether the guessed letter is present in the word involves iterating through the characters of the word.

## DSA Concepts
This Hangman game implementation touches upon several fundamental DSA concepts:

1. **Arrays and ArrayLists**: Used for storing and managing collections of words and guessed letters.
2. **String Manipulation**: Operations such as checking for the presence of letters in the word.
3. **Randomization**: Utilized to select a random word from the list of words.
4. **Iteration**: Employed in traversing characters of the word and elements of collections.
5. **Conditional Statements and Loops**: Used for controlling the flow of the game based on player inputs and conditions.

## Further Enhancements
To expand upon this implementation and deepen its ties with DSA concepts, you could consider the following enhancements:

- Implementing more efficient word selection algorithms (e.g., binary search for a sorted word list).
- Introducing data structures like trees for more advanced game features (e.g., categorizing words into themes or difficulty levels).

## Conclusion
The Hangman game code provides a practical example of how basic DSA concepts can be applied in a real-world scenario. By understanding and extending this implementation, learners can reinforce their understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
